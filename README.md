# Contact-Book
Contact Book using Bootstrap and AngularJs

This project is an contact book application build on AngularJS and Bootstrap.
It is my first Angular JS app and it could contain some bad practices.

I have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server in NodeJs
Step 1: Clone or Download the repo
Step 2: Run npm install
Step 3: Run node src

This will run the server and launch the browser with the URl http://localhost:3000/
